## Build process

- Follow the [React Native Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for getting started building a project with native code. A Mac is required.
- Clone or download the repo
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn run link` to link react-native dependencies
- `yarn start` in one terminal tab to start the packager
- `yarn run ios` in another tab to run the app in the iOS simulator

**Development Keys**: The `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `api/index.js` are for development purposes and do not represent the actual application keys. Feel free to use them or use a new set of keys by creating an [OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) of your own
