# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please feel free to put up a PR for any issue or feature request.

Even if you have little to no experience with React Native, we'll be more than happy to help :)

## Gitter

Please don't hesitate to join our [gitter](https://gitter.im/git-point)! Technical points of discussion, general questions and suggestions or anything at all - we would love to chat about it.

## Reporting issues & features requests

If you notice any bugs in the app, see some code that can be improved, or have features you would like to be added, please create a [bug report](https://github.com/gitpoint/git-point/issues/new?template=BUG_REPORT.md) or a [feature request](https://github.com/gitpoint/git-point/issues/new?template=FEATURE_REQUEST.md)!

If you want to open a PR that fixes a bug or adds a feature, then we can't thank you enough! It is definitely appreciated if an issue has been created before-hand so it can be discussed first.

## Working on issues

Please feel free to take on any issue that's currently open. Feel free to resolve any issue that you would enjoy working on even if it happens to be a low priority.

In order to get started with GitPoint development, check out [our Wiki](https://github.com/gitpoint/git-point/wiki)

## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/git-point).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
