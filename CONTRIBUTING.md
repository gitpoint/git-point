# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please feel free to put up a PR for any issue or feature request.
Even if you have little to no experience with React Native, I'll be more than happy to help. :)

## Setup

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Make a branch for your feature or bug fix
4. Follow the [React Native Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for getting started building a project with native iOS code (a Mac is required)
5. The `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `api/index.js` are for development purposes and do not represent the actual application keys. Feel free to use them or use a new set of keys by creating an [OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) of your own
6. `yarn` to install dependencies
7. `yarn run link` to link react-native dependencies
8. `yarn start` in one terminal tab to start the packager
9. `yarn run ios` in another tab to run the app in the iOS simulator
10. Work your magic! Run the app on an [actual device](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.46/docs/running-on-device.html#running-on-device) as well to test your feature/fix.
11. Add yourself to the [contributor's list](https://github.com/housseindjirdeh/git-point#contributors) by doing `yarn contributors:add`
12. Commit your changes and reference the issue you're addressing (for example: `git commit -am 'Commit message. Closes #5'`)
13. Push your branch to your fork
14. Create a pull request from your branch on your fork to `master` on this repo
15. Have your branch get merged in! :star2:

If you experience a problem at any point, please don't hesitate to file an issue or send me a message!
